name: Gene expression - array - G1 release version 2015-11-02
description: >
  This is the first version of the Gene expression - array - G1 dataset released by ALSPAC.
  
qc_description: >-
  There are two different types of QC'd data available in this version, one performed by David Evans for the
  Bryois et al 2014 paper, and one performed by Gibran Hemani for the molgenis eQTL mapping
  meta analysis.

      LCL's from unrelated individuals were grown under identical conditions and cells
      frozen in RNAlater. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and was
      amplified using the Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification kit (Ambion).
      Expression profiling of the samples, each with two technical replicates, were performed
      using the Illumina Human HT-12 V3 BeadChips (Illumina Inc) including 48,804 probes where
      200 ng of total RNA was processed according to the protocol supplied by Illumina.
      Raw data was imported to the Illumina Beadstudio software and probes with less than
      three beads present were excluded. Log2 - transformed expression signals were then
      normalized with quantile normalization of the replicates of each individual followed by
      quantile normalization across all individuals. We restricted our analysis to 23'935 probes
      tagging genes annotated in Ensembl. Principal component analysis was performed on 931
      individuals. 62 individuals with principal component 1 or 2 greater than one standard
      deviation of the population were excluded from further analysis.
      See http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004461
      for full details.
  - qc_key: Molgenis
    qc_value: >-
      Genetic outliers were removed, any individuals that were clear outliers in the
      first 2 genetic principal components. Each probe was simply quantile normalised and then
      log2 transformed. Then adjusted for the first 4 genetic MDS, expression principal
      components (excluding those that had genetic associations), and scaled to have mean 0 and
      variance 1. See
      https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/eQTL-mapping-analysis-cookbook for full
      details.
