  Version 2022-12-05 Genome-wide array data including raw files and genotype calls for G0 mothers
  This release version of the gwa_660_g0m data has two differnt QC'd
  set of files. 

  This version differs from the preivous relase version because we
  have changed the second column in the previous version
  in legacy 1 qc'd set of data, from all A to all M. To refelect that
  this data is a mothers dataset and this can now be used as a Qlet.
qc_description: >-
  The following is the description we have of the QC procedure for
  either leg1 or leg2 files.

  
  ALSPAC mothers were genotyped using the Illumina human660W-quad
  array at Centre National de GÃ©notypage (CNG) and genotypes were
  called with Illumina GenomeStudio. PLINK (v1.07) was used to carry
  out quality control measures on an initial set of 10,015 subjects
  and 557,124 directly genotyped SNPs. SNPs were removed if they
  displayed more than 5% missingness or a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P
  value of less than 1.0e-06. Additionally SNPs with a minor allele
  frequency of less than 1% were removed. Samples were excluded if
  they displayed more than 5% missingness, had indeterminate X
  chromosome heterozygosity or extreme autosomal
  heterozygosity. Samples showing evidence of population
  stratification were identified by multidimensional scaling of
  genome-wide identity by state pairwise distances using the four
  HapMap populations as a reference, and then excluded. Cryptic
  relatedness was assessed using a IBD estimate of more than 0.125
  which is expected to correspond to roughly 12.5% alleles shared IBD
  or a relatedness at the first cousin level. Related subjects that
  passed all other quality control thresholds were retained during
  subsequent phasing and imputation. 9,048 subjects and 526,688 SNPs
  passed these quality control filters.
