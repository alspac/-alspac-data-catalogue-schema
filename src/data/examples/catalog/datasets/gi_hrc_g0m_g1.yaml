name: Genome-wide - HRC imputed - G0 mothers + G1
description: >-
  Genome-wide array data imputed to the HRC reference panel for G0
  mothers and G1 individuals (HRC.r1.1, 2016).

  SNP chips are useful for the generation of data on hundreds of
  thousands of SNPs, but there are millions more polymorphisms that
  remain untyped with this technology. If suitable numbers of whole
  genome sequences exist (e.g. 1000 genomes data) then millions of
  genotypes that are missing from a sample because they have not been
  typed by SNP chips can be imputed using probabilistic methods. Here
  the ALSPAC mother and children data were imputed to a new reference
  panel known as the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel. This
  comprises around 31000 sequenced individuals (mostly European), so
  the coverage of European haplotypes is much greater than in other
  panels.
  As a consequence imputation accuracy is expected to improve,
  particularly at lower frequencies.

  The ALSPAC genotype data generated using the Illumina HumanHap550
  quad (children) and Illumina human660W quad (mothers)
  has been jointly phased using ShapeIt v2
  (which uses relationship information to improve phasing accuracy)
  and imputed to the HRC panel (HRC.r1.1) using the Michigan imputation server.
