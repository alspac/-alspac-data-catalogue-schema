name: Genome-wide - 1000G imputed - G0 mothers + G1
description: >-
  Genome-wide array data imputed to the 1000 genomes reference panel
  for G0 mothers and G1 individuals.
  SNP chips are useful for the generation of data on hundreds of
  thousands of SNPs, but there are millions more polymorphisms that
  remain untyped with this technology. If suitable numbers of whole
  genome sequences exist (e.g. 1000 genomes data) then millions of
  genotypes that are missing from a sample because they have not been
  typed by SNP chips can be imputed using probabilistic methods. Here
  the ALSPAC mother (G0) and children (G1) data were imputed to 1000 genomes using the best available phasing and imputation software and reference panels at the time.

  The ALSPAC genotype data generated using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad (children) and Illumina human660W quad (mothers) has been jointly imputed to the 1000 genomes reference panel (Version 1, Phase 3, Dec 2013 Release).
