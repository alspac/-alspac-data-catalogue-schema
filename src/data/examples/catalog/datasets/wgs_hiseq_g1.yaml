id: alspacdcs:wgs_hiseq_g1
name: Whole genome sequencing - G1
description: >-
  Whole genome sequencing for G1 individuals, part of the UK10K
  dataset. ALSPAC and TwinsUK cohorts were sequenced at an average
  read depth of 6.7x through the UK10K program (http://www.UK10K.org)
  using the Illumina HiSeq platform, and aligned to the GRCh37 human
  reference using BWA. SNV calls were completed using
  samtools/bcftools and VQSR and GATK were used to recall these calls.
