name: Genome-wide - CNV - G1 release version 2015-11-09
description: >-
  This release contains predicted ALSPAC CNVs using PennCNV.
  
  LRR and BAF data was missing from the 23andMe raw genotype data,
  so we had to generate this data ourselves using an in house
  algorithm that Tom Gaunt  wrote (see make.sh in code release).

  Once this data has been generated, we ran PennCNV using the hh550
  libraries.
  This was done using a script called PennCNV.sh (We do not have a
  location for this script currently). 


  
qc_description: >-
     Anna Guyatt generated filtered PennCNV calls. One sample with an ALN
     ending in 'D' was removed (see known issues). Multiple calls were
     merged using the 'clean_cnv.pl' (From PennCNV) script,
     using a merge fraction of 0.5. Individuals with > 30 CNVs, a Log
     R Ratio SD of >0.3, a BAF drift of > 0.002, and a waviness factor of > 0.05 were removed using the
     'filter_cnv.pl' script. CNVs in which at least 50% of the length of the CNV call
     overlapped with any of telomeric centromeric, immunoglobulin regions were removed using the 'scan_region.pl'
     script in PennCNV. The files used to define these regions are
     provided (SN not sure they are). In addition,
     CNVs covering fewer than 5 probes, of a length < 5kb, and with a
     confidence score of below 10 were removed, using the
     'filter_cnv.pl' (From PennCNV) script.
     Density was calculated as the number of probes in a CNV divided
     by the length of the CNV,
     and CNVs where the density of probes across the call was < 1
     probe per 20kb was removed.

     These QC parameters are suggestions only. Analysts can apply
     their own filter parameters to the raw calls in data.cnv,
     using the 'clean_cnv.pl', 'scan_region.pl' and 'filter_cnv.pl' programs in PennCNV.

    issue_description: >-
       23andMe identifiers were in the form "ALSPAC<n>" where <n> is a
       numeric identifier. I had to use the "23andMe.recode" file to convert these
       identifiers back to ALN:QLET.  However, there are some "duplicate" ALNs in this
       file, e.g.see ALSPAC09899933 (ALN 38877) and ALSPAC09900002 (ALN 38877D).
       Therefore, I used ALSPAC_10K_UNRELATEDS_FINAL.fam (the magic
       8365 dataset) to fetch a list of identifiers that I should be
       using,i.e. should I use the 38877 or 38877D ALN.

       For the final version of the dataset, I removed any remaining
       "D" characters from the ALN:QLET (as per conversations with Chris Raistrick).

       Also, there were some "missing" individuals from the 23andMe raw data, see run.out.
